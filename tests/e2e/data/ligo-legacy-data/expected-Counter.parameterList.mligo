#import "counter-module-main.mligo" "Contract"

// When this file was created, the smart contract was defined with a main function that was within a named module. As such, the examples below are written with that assumption in mind.

// IMPORTANT: We suggest always explicitly typing your parameter values:
// E.g.: `let parameter: int = 10` or `let parameter: Contract.[Namespace].parameter = 10`
